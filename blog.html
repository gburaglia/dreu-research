					<h3 id= "week1"> The Beginning</h3>
					<p>My official REU journey began on May 23. I meet with Dr. Dillon, as well as another student named Gustavo who began the same day. The meeting was quick and brief, he kindly gave us the code to the REU student lab and told us our project assignments. Then, I spent the rest of the day giving Gustavo a tour of the campus since he had just arrived at UF.
 </p> <br>
 
<p> On Wednesday, I met with my team so we could all get acquainted with each other. On Thursday, we had our first lab meeting. The first week was slow as we waited to find out more details about our project. I really like the other students assigned to my team. I’m feeling excited to see how this summer unfolds!

					<h3 id=week2>Feeling It Out</h3>
					<p>We’ve learned more about our project. At the lab meeting this week we found out that most of the other projects have PhD leads. However, we’re one of the few teams that doesn’t have a lead. This could be both positive and negative. Without close leadership it might be hard to get the project started, or even to steer it in the right direction later on. However, it also gives us more opportunities to take charge ourselves and develop better leadership skills. At the lab meeting we were also told that we could schedule one meeting with Chris Crawford, one of the PhD students most involved with the first Brain Drone Race. We spoke to him and to best suit his schedule we are going to meet with him next Monday. Both Dr. Gilbert and Chris emphasized that this meeting should be a one time “sparking” session. So we’re all hoping that the “spark” will be electrifying, if you know what I mean.</p> <br>

					<h3 id=week3>The spark</h3>
					<p>This week we began with high hopes and excitement. We met with Chris to finally get a run through of the equipment and tools used in the first Brain Drone Race. We received a lot of information during the 2-hour session. However, it was still not enough. We spent the rest of the week recreating the drone flights with and without the EMOTIV headset by trial and error since Chris didn’t get a chance to show us a demonstration flight. We also recorded information about the previous race and conducted an analysis of the negative and positive aspects, as well as possible improvements. We will continue familiarization with the equipment and begin our final document in the next week. The general consensus is that we’re excited to dive into this project, but there is a lot of challenges since we have limited information about the previous race.

					<h3 id="week4">Underway</h3>
					<p>The wheels are rolling. We each wrote sections for the final document this week. My sections were “Promotion” and “Participant Recruitment”. We then met up and conduct a group review of all the sections. It went well! We are now on our way to completing the first draft of our final document. We each picked more sections to write and we plan to meet up next Tuesday again to review those. So by next week the first draft should be complete. Besides that, this week we also brainstormed testing ideas. We identified three issues we want to target. The drones have a considerable amount of drift when in flight. The “line follow” program has low to no functionality (the drone pretty much goes in whichever direction it desires). And we aren’t sure what the optimal tolerance should be on the EmoKey. We have already picked a day to begin testing. We know it will be a long trial and error process, but it will be exciting to try out our ideas.

					<h3>Stumbles</h3>
					<p>This week was frustrating. The group is getting tired of documentation, which is understandable. However, it means that several group members have stopped doing their part. They say they want to do more testing, but I don’t see them active with that either. It’s difficult without any formal leadership. Those that are doing their part try to remind the others to keep working and setting targets to accomplish during the week. However, at the peer level there’s only so much reminding that can be done. 
</p><br>
                    <p>As for testing, those that participated, tried flying the drone both indoors and outdoors. Some progress was made this week, but nothing significant. We are at a road block. However, next week can be a new start. I hope we are able to regroup and regain momentum. And hopefully make more progress next week both in documentation and testing. Although this week wasn’t great, I’m confident next week will be better.

					<h3>Progress</h3>
					<p>This week was significantly better from a progress standpoint. We were able to meet with Chris again and we found a crucial bug in the code! By fixing the error in the code the line follow program improved significantly. There is still a lot of room for improvement, but now we have a better idea of what to focus on in the code. We are in the process of 3D printing propeller guards for the smaller drone, the BeBop 2. The fit was measured by hand with calipers so it has been a bit of trial and error. We had originally wanted to use a 3D scanner to make this process easier, but the scanner we have access to isn’t accurate enough to help with the small measurements we need. So that is currently underway. And a member of our team was able to get the BeBop to takeoff on a keystroke, which is a great step forward!
